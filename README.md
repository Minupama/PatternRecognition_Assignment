# PatternRecognition_Assignment
This project is developed by Data Alchemists to train a custom model on the Defungi dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. In addition to our custom model, we have also employed ResNet50 and VGG16 pre-trained models, fine-tuning them for our specific classification task.
